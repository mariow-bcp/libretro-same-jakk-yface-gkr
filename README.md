# libretro-same-jakk-yface gkr

A work in progress libretro core for Jakks Pacific Plug and Play games. This core is not going anywhere in progress 
currently as it will fail to compile if you try to compile it. it is still doing progress but slow though.

How it will work?

This project is actually one of three cores, all of which emulate Sunplus 2 game systems.

1. Same_Jakk-yface, Emulating Jakks Pacfic Plug and Play Systems which have a Sunplus 2 like Arcade Gold.
2. Same_Jakk-yface (GKR), Basically it emulates Jakks Pacific Plug and Play game consoles which support GameKey cartridges. This is the project i am currently working on first.
3. Same_Jakk-vii-face, Supports game consoles which have a Sunplus 2 like Vii, Vii Only, will later support consoles like Mattel Hyperscan and V.Smile.
